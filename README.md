a tool that can provide consultation data without using in-store resources. Currently, only in-person consultations are completed.


### Features

- Registration and Login for patients and admins
- Self-directed consultations to gather information on tattoo removal services
- A list of quotes completed that can be viewed and deleted
- Admins can view full user lists, search by first name, and search by email
